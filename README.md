# MUCas
This is a TensorFlow implementation of paper "Multi-Scale Graph Capsule with Influence Attention for Information Cascades Size Prediction", will come soon.
# Overview
- `data/` put the download dataset here;
- `model/` contains the implementation of the MUCas;
- `preprocessing/` contains preprocessing codeï¼š
    * split the data to train set, validation set and test set (`utils.py`);
    * trainsform the datasets to the format of ".pkl" (`preprocess_signal.py`)
- `config.py` you can configure parameters and filepath in this file
